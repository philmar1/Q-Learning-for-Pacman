# Q-Learning-for-Pacman

This project is a Reinforcement Learning project. It builds an AI player of the Pacman game based on Q-Learning method. It was programmed on python based on the files and librairies provided by the CS188 course of UC Berkeley. 

The classes I modified may be found in the qlearningAgents.py. Codes need to be ran with Python2.
